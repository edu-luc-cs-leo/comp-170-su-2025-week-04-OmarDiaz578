# The first area I see that I can improve on is icluding type hints. My work doesn't include any and now I realize how important it can be. My comments can also be more detailed as well. If I had to change the code to provide an option for the triangle to switch sides is to include something to specify if itll be a left or right triangle. this will either print the spaces in descending order followed by a hash mark to print the right angle to its right.
